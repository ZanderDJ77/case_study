# Brainstorm Questions
- Where are AirBNBs expensive?
- Borough? Neighborhood?
- Do other factors (room type affect price?) What about rating?
- How long are AirBNBs active?
- Are Air BNBs Illegal and do they shut down?
- Which units have the most availability?
- How is the review socore impacted by location?
- How many apartments are run by one host?


## First Questions - Where are AirBNBs Expensive? How does rating impact price? 
First try by myself
```{r}
summary(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = stars, y = price, fill = borough)) + 
  geom_violin()
